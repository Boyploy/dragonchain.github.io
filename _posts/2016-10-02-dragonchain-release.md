## Open Source Release

Disney released Dragonchain on October 2, 2016 with a modified Apache 2 open source license. Dragonchain is a distributed crypto ledger framework protocol that makes it easy to create cost-efficient business networks where virtually anything of value can be tracked and tradedâ€”without requiring a central point of control.

Blockchain technology works as an electronic record-keeping and transaction-processing system that allows all parties to track information through a secure network focusing on interoperability, scalability, performance and security. Proponents of Blockchain technology, which originates from _the_ digital currency *Bitcoin*, say that it will make all kinds of transactions transparent, more reliable, and easier to audit without centralized processing.

Dragonchain provides support for a smart contract language within a hybrid permissioned and public ledger network using a unique consensus algorithm with context based verification.

A small team at Disney developed the blockchain platform internally in 2016.
