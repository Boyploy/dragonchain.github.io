### The Mouse Roars: Disney Unveils Dragonchain

> To the wonderment of many, Walt Disney Company unveiled its new open-source hybrid blockchain platform earlier this week. The Disney blockchain is being referred to as Dragonchain, and it’s just the latest reminder of how quickly the company adapts to new technological innovations. Though there has been no clear explanation about how Disney plans to use its new distributed ledger, its description of the technology emphasized its multicurrency support and enterprise capability. For now, the real story is that the world’s second-largest media and entertainment company appears to be fully on-board with blockchain technology.

> Of course, Disney has been an innovative company since its founding nearly a century ago, as it pushed the boundaries of animation technology even in its early days. Later, the company’s theme parks would carry on that tradition, with groundbreaking high-tech rides like the Matterhorn Bobsleds – the roller coaster that was so innovative that it is considered by many to be the first real example of the modern roller coaster. The company later introduced audio animatronics into the Disneyland park, followed years later by motion-base simulators and other cutting-edge advancements.

> The company has even moved into virtual reality tech to assist with park design and has invested a reported $1 billion on its MagicBand technology that uses context-aware technology to provide a friction-free experience for the park’s visitors. Of course, the Mouse has been busy in recent years buying many of our most beloved childhood treasures: Marvel Entertainment, LucasFilm, the Muppets, and more. But the company has also continued to be future-focused as well, and its foray into blockchain technology is just more evidence of its commitment to remain at the forefront of innovation.
