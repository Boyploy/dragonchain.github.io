### What Disney Actually Wants to Achieve With its Own Blockchain

> Disney’s Dragonchain platform claims it will simplify real business applications onto a hybrid blockchain. The project allows for easy integration, business data security, multi-currency features, fixed 5-second blocks and more. The platform was released publicly on October 2 and was developed by a “small but very cool team of Blockchain technology advocates.”

> Documentation for Dragonchain on GitHub is roughly 15 pages long, with a first draft description of its capabilities. This includes development services for those unfamiliar with distributed ledger technology, default data protection, interoperability with other blockchains both public and private, and agnostic currency support.

> Disney released the blockchain protocol with a modified Apache 2 open source license. The framework is similar to many blockchain prototypes with features such as timestamping, block ID, hashing prior blocks, PoW/ PoS capabilities, and digital signatures. Dragonchain gives various definitions for business verification, enterprise validation, network diversity, notarization, and public and proprietary checkpoints.

> The paper explains that it makes sense at the moment to leverage the “ever growing external Bitcoin ecosystem.” “Bitcoin cryptography in a private currency will enable the transparent use of hardware signing wallets for internal use (e.g. KeepKey, Trezor, Ledger). Another example is that of tokenization, whereby one may directly integrate Bitcoin tokenization provider technology for use with an internal blockchain (e.g. Counterparty or Tokenly),” Dragonchain’s GitHub description details.
