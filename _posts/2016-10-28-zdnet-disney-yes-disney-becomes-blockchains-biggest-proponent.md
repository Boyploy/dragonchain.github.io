### Disney, yes Disney, becomes blockchain's biggest proponent

> The Dragonchain release notes that blockchain "will make all kinds of transactions transparent, more reliable, and easier to audit without centralized processing," providing "support for a smart contract language within a hybrid permissioned and public ledger network using a unique consensus algorithm with context based verification."

> There is a wide range of potential applications for Disney, from financial transactions to daily operations, These include "trading Disney issued assets, partnered services issuing tokens, and accepting existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin," Redman states. In addition, Disney could "create blockchain-based programs for its fast lane feature within Disney theme parks. The platform could monitor ride times and the length of lines in order to create a more efficient process."

> A recent report published by the IBM Institute for Business Value explored potential of blockchain beyond cyrptocurrency, noting that blockchains "shift the paradigm from information held by a single owner to a shared lifetime history of an asset or transaction."

> Instead of "messaging-based communications," the IBM report continues, "the new paradigm is state-based. Information that was once obscure now becomes visible. The ledger is shared, updated with every transaction and selectively replicated among participants in near real-time. Privacy is maintained via cryptographic techniques and/or data partitioning techniques to give participants selective visibility into the ledger; both transactions and the identity of transacting parties can be masked."
