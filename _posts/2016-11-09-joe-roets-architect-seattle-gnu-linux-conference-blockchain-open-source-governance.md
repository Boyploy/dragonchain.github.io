### Joe Roets Speaking at Seattle GNU/Linux Conference

#### Blockchain and Cryptocurrency for Free and Open Source Project Governance

##### A look at Value Based Consensus Networks in the Management of Open Source Projects

What potential benefits does the application of blockchain technology offer an open source community?

[The talk](https://osem.seagl.org/conference/seagl2016/program/proposal/121) will highlight the events within Bitcoin and the governance and control mechanisms that are currently available to the network.

Discussion of mechanisms implemented within Dash and Tezos (and others) in the interest of improving governance capabilities in cryptocurrency.

Will offer ideas for how open source projects that are not cryptocurrencies may leverage such technology, and what metrics may be considered.

Speaker is Dragonchain Founder and Maintainer [Joe Roets](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j0j0r0).
